# Market Titans

Implementation of the Titans paper approach for market data prediction.

## Overview

This project implements the Titans architecture from the paper "Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time" for market data prediction. The implementation includes:

- Neural Memory Module with test-time learning
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Support for multiple assets
- Comprehensive metrics and visualizations
- Automated model saving and testing pipeline

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Data loading and feature engineering
- `models/`: Neural network models implementation
  - `memory_module.py`: Neural Memory Module
  - `attention.py`: Multi-head attention
  - `titans.py`: Main Titans model
- `utils/`: Utility functions for metrics and visualization
- `configs/`: Configuration files
- `train.py`: Main training script
- `test.py`: Model evaluation script
- `saved_models/`: Directory for saved model checkpoints (gitignored)
- `test_results/`: Directory for test results and visualizations (gitignored)

## Usage

1. Configure parameters in `configs/config.yaml`
2. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
3. Test the latest model:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Training Process

The training script (`train.py`):
- Splits data into training and validation sets
- Trains the model for specified epochs
- Automatically saves the best model based on validation loss
- Generates validation metrics and visualizations
- Saves model checkpoints in `saved_models/` directory

## Testing Process

The testing script (`test.py`):
- Automatically loads the latest trained model
- Evaluates on the last month of market data
- Generates comprehensive test metrics
- Creates prediction visualizations
- Saves test results in `test_results/` directory

## Features

- Test-time learning with memory updates
- Surprise-based memory mechanism
- Support for multiple market symbols
- Technical indicators as features
- Performance visualization and metrics
- Automated model checkpointing
- Separate validation and test sets

## Configuration

Key parameters in `config.yaml`:
- Data parameters (symbols, dates, window sizes)
- Model architecture (dimensions, layers)
- Training parameters (batch size, learning rates, epochs)

## Results

The model provides:
- Market predictions with confidence metrics
- Surprise value visualization
- Performance metrics (MSE, MAE, Correlation, Directional Accuracy)
- Saved model checkpoints for best performing models
- Comprehensive test results and visualizations 

## Cloud Deployment Options

### Google Colab (Easiest)
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Clone the repository:
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/todorkolev/titans-market-data.git
```
4. Install the dependencies:
```bash
!cd titans-market-data && pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the training:
```bash
!cd titans-market-data && python train.py
```

### AWS EC2
1. Launch an EC2 instance (recommended: g4dn.xlarge for GPU support)
2. Connect to your instance:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-ip
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip git
```
4. Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/todorkolev/titans-market-data.git
cd titans-market-data
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
```

For persistent storage, consider attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance.
